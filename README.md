#Philpapers API Rewrite

Requirements:
This project requires python 3 or higher, as well as the anytree library (which can be installed via pip). It also requires a philpapers api key and user ID (both of which can be obtained here: https://philpapers.org/help/api/json.html). These two values must be located in a file called api.py, which must contain two variables: apiKey and userID. apiKey must contain the user's API key, while userID must contain their user ID.
